        Hi! My name is Nicole Pullano. I am a current junior at Syracuse University. I am pursuing a major in Advertising in the S.I Newhouse School of Public Communication and a minor in Information Management and Technology in the iSchool. I am interested in account and strategic planning as well as analyzing data to create fruitful insights that create an ad campaign. 

        In Spring of 2021 I interned as a media coordinator for the grassroots “Pullano Board of Education” campaign where I designed the logo and artwork as well as monitoring social media account. I applied real-time analytics to changes in the media plan. In the summer of 2022, I interned at Fusion Public Relations in the account coordinator position. I curated media lists, coordinated interviews, wrote and emailed pitches, created news roundups, wrote meeting agendas, and organized briefing documents. 
        
        Outside of work, I greatly enjoy exercising, traveling, going to the beach, skiing, trying out new restaurants and spending time with friends. When I am not hanging out with family and friends, I love binge watching shows on Netflix and Hulu such as Sex and the City and How I Met Your Mother.
