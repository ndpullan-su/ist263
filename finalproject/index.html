    <h1>A Summer In Europe</h1>
    My name is Nicole Pullano. I am currently a junior at the S.I Newhouse school of Public Communications studying Advertising and pursuing a minor in Information Management & Technology in the School of Information Sciences.<br>
     This past summer, I got the opportunity to study abroad for six weeks in Florence and London, and then traveled to Paris & the French Riviera with my family.  This website was created as part of my web development class to showcase my wonderful experiences and memories while traveling through Europe!
