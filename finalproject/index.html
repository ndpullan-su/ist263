    <h1><center>A Summer In Europe</center></h1>
    <center>My name is Nicole Pullano. I am currently a junior at the S.I Newhouse school of Public Communications studying Advertising and pursuing a minor<br> in Information Management & Technology in the School of Information Sciences.
     This past summer, I got the opportunity to study abroad for six weeks<br> in Florence and London, and then traveled to Paris & the French Riviera with my family.  This website was created as part of my web development class<br> to showcase my wonderful experiences and memories while traveling through Europe. In the Food & Culture section, I go into a deep dive about my<br>favorite restuarants and meals I had in each location. From homemade pizzas, to truffle pasta and meals withthe freshest ingredients, food was an obvious highlight in Europe. <br> In People & Places, I explain my experience immersing myself in new cultures, comparing each place to home and other locations. From bustling London markets to relaxing Cannes beaches and a winery tour in Italy, my cultural experience abroad was all over the spectrum, and I wouldn't have it any other way!  </center>
